forkedFrom (Does your project originate from another project): No

methodology (what is being counted as tvl, how is tvl being calculated): 'Counts the number of wrapped native tokens in all yield strategies across all the chains the protocol is deployed on + staking counts the number of BIOS tokens staked in the kernels across all the chains (PFA: Protocol Fee Accruals by staking assets)'
